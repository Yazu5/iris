<p>i think about the future often, and it always leads me to you. i imagine moments of laughter, of care, and quiet companionship. i imagine building trust and understanding together. i imagine being more patient and attentive. i imagine proving that my love can be gentle and true. these thoughts are what sustain me. they are why i continue to hope.</p>

<p>my love for you is not fleeting or shallow. it is deep, intentional, and sincere. it is rooted in everything we shared and everything i still believe we can have. i have no desire to love anyone else. no one else could ever feel like home to me. my heart refuses to wander. it remains loyal to you.</p>

<p>every day without you is a reminder of what matters most. absence has not diminished my care. absence has not made my love any less genuine. if anything, it has clarified it. it has shown me the depth of my feelings. it has shown me what it truly wants.</p>

<p>even when life feels uncertain, i remain steadfast. i know that God has plans beyond my understanding. i trust that if it is meant for us, we will find our way back. until then, my heart waits patiently. it waits without distraction. it waits without compromise. it waits only for you.</p>

<p>i remember the moments when you made me feel safe and understood. those moments were not ordinary. they shaped the way i see love. they taught me what it means to care deeply. they made me certain that my heart belongs with you. that certainty has not left me. it remains strong.</p>

<p>i hope you know that i have grown from our past. i have learned patience, humility, and understanding. i have learned how to love more carefully and intentionally. i have reflected on mistakes and learned from them. all of this growth exists because of you. all of this growth exists for the possibility of us. it is proof of my commitment.</p>

<p>i remain committed, faithful, and sincere. i remain hopeful without pressure. i remain loving without expectation. my heart belongs to you and you alone. no one else has a place here. no one else can take your space. it remains reserved for you, always.</p>

<p>i know that life may be unpredictable. timing may not always feel right. but my heart continues to choose you. it chooses you with patience, hope, and devotion. it chooses you without distraction or compromise. it chooses you because it has always known its home. it chooses you because love cannot lie.</p>

<p>thinking of you brings clarity to my intentions. i am not fickle or indecisive. i am not distracted by other possibilities. my love is focused and unwavering. it is built on sincerity and truth. it is anchored in hope. it is reserved for you, and you alone.</p>

<p>even in moments of longing, i find peace. that peace comes from knowing my love is genuine. that peace comes from knowing my heart is faithful. that peace comes from trusting that what is true cannot be erased. i will wait as long as it takes. i will hope as quietly and sincerely as i can. my heart will remain yours.</p>

<p>i do not regret loving you. even in mistakes and distance, loving you has been the most real thing in my life. even in hardship, loving you has taught me patience, humility, and hope. those lessons remain with me. they shape who i am. they prepare me for a future, if it is ever with you. they remind me why my heart cannot accept anyone else.</p>

<p>i want you to know that my prayers are always for you. they are not for anyone else to replace you. they are not distracted or divided. they are singular and sincere. they are for your happiness, your growth, and your return. they are for the hope that we might be together again. my prayers remain constant.</p>

<p>my heart will never abandon what it truly wants. it will never give itself to someone else. it will never compromise its fidelity. it has chosen you completely. it waits only for you. it hopes only for you. it belongs to you, always.</p>

<p>every day, my thoughts return to you. they return with love, care, and longing. they return with clarity of intention. they return with hope that our paths might cross again. they return with faith in God’s timing. they return with patience and devotion. they return always to you.</p>

<p>i cannot imagine a future with anyone else. my heart has decided, and that decision is final. it remains faithful. it remains steadfast. it remains committed. it remains hopeful. it remains yours.</p>

<p>if one day you choose to come back, you will find a heart ready and open. you will find someone who has learned from mistakes. you will find love that has grown and matured. you will find faith that has strengthened. you will find hope that has remained. you will find devotion that is unwavering. you will find me, waiting only for you.</p>

<p>until that day, i remain patient and faithful. i remain committed and sincere. i remain loving and hopeful. no one else can take your place. no one else can hold my heart. no one else could ever be you. i wait quietly, steadfastly, and faithfully.</p>

<p>our chats were more than simple exchanges to me. they became moments where i felt heard and understood. even without meeting or defining anything, the connection felt real. those conversations gave comfort in quiet ways. i never treated them casually. they mattered to me more than i ever expected.</p>

<p>i still remember the small details in how we talked. the timing of your replies, the tone of your words, the ease of the conversation. those little things built a sense of closeness over time. at the time, it felt natural and unforced. ngayon ko lang talaga na-realize how meaningful those moments were.</p>

<p>there was no label between us, and i respected that. i never tried to rush or turn it into something it was not. i allowed everything to stay honest and simple. that patience came from respect, not hesitation. what we had grew quietly, and that is why it stayed with me.</p>

<p>my feelings developed slowly and without intention. i did not plan for them, and i did not force them. they came from consistency and sincerity. every message added something to that feeling. kahit hindi ko inaasahan, it became important to me.</p>

<p>sometimes i wonder what it would be like to talk again, even briefly. not to reopen anything, but just to reconnect in the way we once did. this thought is not meant to pressure you. it is simply an honest reflection. even after time has passed, the respect i have for you remains.</p>

<p>i want you to know that nothing i felt was careless or temporary. i valued your time and presence, even in conversations. there was intention behind every message. hindi iyon basta pampalipas oras for me. that is why the connection stayed meaningful.</p>

<p>if these words reach you, i hope they are received gently. they are not meant to demand or expect anything. they exist only to express honesty. what we shared may have been quiet, but it was sincere. and that sincerity is something i still hold with care.</p>

<p>Isaiah 60:22</p>

<p>“when the time is right, I the Lord will make it happen”</p>

<p>Merry Christmas, My Iris.</p>
